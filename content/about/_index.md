Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.

The 4 main types of Coffee Beans Defined:

* Arabica -  the most delicate of the 4 . It is easily influenced by its environment and prone to disease. It must be farmed with great care. When Arabica plants are grown in climates where they do not naturally thrive, it can take double the effort to keep them healthy.

* Robusta (Coffea caniphora) - It is extremely tolerant of its environment and practically immune to disease. Robusta coffee can withstand myriad altitudes, but particularly requires a hot climate where rainfall is irregular.

* Liberica (Coffea liberica) - It harder to come by in the coffee world these days, but this varietal has an important place in the world’s coffee history.

* Excelsa (Coffea excelsa or Coffea liberica var. dewevrei) - Excelsa grows mostly in Southeast Asia and accounts for a mere 7% of the world’s coffee circulation. It is largely used in blends in order to give the coffee an extra boost of flavor and complexity, better affecting the middle and back palate.
